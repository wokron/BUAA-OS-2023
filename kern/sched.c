/* Overview:
 *   Implement a round-robin scheduling to select a runnable env and schedule it using 'env_run'.
 *
 * Post-Condition:
 *   If 'yield' is set (non-zero), 'curenv' should not be scheduled again unless it is the only
 *   runnable env.
 *
 * Hints:
 *   1. The variable 'count' used for counting slices should be defined as 'static'.
 *   2. Use variable 'env_sched_list', which contains and only contains all runnable envs.
 *   3. You shouldn't use any 'return' statement because this function is 'noreturn'.
 */
void schedule(int yield) {
	static int count = 0; // remaining time slices of current env
	struct Env *e = curenv;

	/* We always decrease the 'count' by 1.
	 *
	 * If 'yield' is set, or 'count' has been decreased to 0, or 'e' (previous 'curenv') is
	 * 'NULL', or 'e' is not runnable, then we pick up a new env from 'env_sched_list' (list of
	 * all runnable envs), set 'count' to its priority, and schedule it with 'env_run'. **Panic
	 * if that list is empty**.
	 *
	 * (Note that if 'e' is still a runnable env, we should move it to the tail of
	 * 'env_sched_list' before picking up another env from its head, or we will schedule the
	 * head env repeatedly.)
	 *
	 * Otherwise, we simply schedule 'e' again.
	 *
	 * You may want to use macros below:
	 *   'TAILQ_FIRST', 'TAILQ_REMOVE', 'TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL'
